            Welcome to <strong>Break the Spire</strong> — an espionage and infiltration campaign setting for{" "}
            <em>DaggerHeart</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The island of <strong>Temris</strong> stands divided, ruled by four very different lords — each
            watching from their towering seat of power, the <em>Spires</em>. Their rivalries keep the realm
            fragile, but independent… for now.
        </p>

        <p>
            You and your companions are covert agents, sent by the mighty Emperor
            to infiltrate Temris. Your mission: weaken the Spires from within, and prepare the island for
            conquest. In just a few short months, the Emperor’s vast armies will arrive to claim what you’ve
            softened.
        </p>

        <p>
            But once you’ve walked the streets of Temris, forged bonds, and uncovered its secrets — will you
            remain loyal to the Emperor’s will? Or will you betray your mission, stand with the Spires, and
            fight to defend Temris from the invasion to come?
        </p>

        <p>
            This expansion introduces new <strong>domains</strong> and <strong>cards</strong> steeped in
            intrigue, sabotage, and divided loyalties. It’s a game of spies in shadow, where every choice may
            determine the fate of an entire island.
